Task 0: Sum of Variable Parameters
Create a function that computes the sum of a variable number of parameters. The function should have the following prototype: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...); If n is equal to 0, return 0.

Task 1: Print Numbers with Separator
Develop a function that prints a specified number of integers, separated by a given string, and followed by a new line. The function should be defined as follows: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...); If the separator is NULL, don't print it.

Task 2: Print Strings with Separator
Write a function that prints a set of strings, separated by a specified string, and ends with a new line. The function's prototype is: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...); If the separator is NULL, don't print it. If any of the strings are NULL, print "(nil)" instead.

Task 3: Print Anything
Create a function that prints a variety of data types based on a format string. The format string specifies the type of each argument (c: char, i: integer, f: float, s: string). If a string argument is NULL, print "(nil)" instead. Ignore any other characters in the format string. You are allowed to use a limited number of control structures, loops, and variables as specified in the task.
